    <h1 id="e0" class="patchnotes"> Welcome to Undersided!</h1>
  <p class="patchnotes">"Undersided" is a project by <a href="#vg">Vector Graphics</a> detailing the world of ʏᴏɴᴀ. The project is an expansion of the setting of <em>Undertale</em> by Toby Fox, and from the perspective of that community it can be seen as an AU. The official media for Undersided largely consists of excerpts from in-universe documents detailing the phenomena, events, and people that are important to the history of a region known as "Liruzon", where Undertale's story takes place.</p>
  <h3 class="patchnotes"> Conventions</h3>
  <p class="patchnotes">The documents here are translated from the original language they are written in (often modern Rahazuna or Nideri) into English. To do this faithfully, several conventions have had to be chosen.</p>
  <div class="list">
  <ul class="centerlist">
    <li><p>The term "monster" is not used for the magic-based race that inhabits the world alongside humans. Instead, the term "yaref" [plural: yarov] from the original language is loaned. This is done to avoid ambiguity with other senses of "monster". Similarly with "magic" being replaced with "yahir".</p></li>
    <li><p>Other potentially ambiguous terminology, such as "DETERMINATION", "SOUL", "SAVE", and others, is spelled in ALL CAPS.</p></li>
    <li><p>Units, except units of time, are presented in familiar terms to Earth readers, such as meters and kilograms. Units of time smaller than a day are in the familiar 24:60:60 format (as that is what is used in-universe), but these are slightly longer than their Earth counterparts. A year of 301 Yona days is split into eight months alternating 37 and 38 days, and an extra day at the end of the year called <em>Arvendanula</em>, which serves as the winter holiday. However, the lifespans of the in-universe humans turn out to be approximately 80 of these years, which is about 70 of our own.</p></li>
    <li><p>Place names are not, in general, translated, though there may be exceptions.</p></li>
    <li><p>Many names provided by Toby Fox only work in English (due to puns, Western naming conventions, or other such things), and are posited to be localized versions of in-universe names, which are used here. For example, instead of "Asgore", "Ruaeli" is used; instead of "Frisk", "Ana-hin" is used; instead of "Sans", "Arfia" is used. Character designs are posited to be similarly localized (in regards to clothing customs, connotations, pop culture, etc), though places where Undertale explicitly deviates from our world are kept.</p></li>

<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>913, Rahazun</em> </h1>
<h4>Humans and yarov</h4>
    <p dir="ltr">
        <span>A long time ago, the world was ruled by two races: HUMANS and MONSTERS (who may alternatively and preferably be called "Yarov"). In Liruzon, they used to live in harmony with one another. However, soon, a war broke out between the two races. We don't remember the exact cause. Humans are bad at remembering tales like these. Combine that with the relative scarcity of information on Siegetev's regime. And, well, Yarzon... they've kept quiet about it for long enough. But what we do know is that eventually, the yarov of Liruzon, with nowhere else left to go (after the Great Evacuation, which led to the formation of Yarzon, was stopped by Siegetev), were forced to retreat to the cursed mountain of Mt. Ebott. It was Rahazunic Chief Engineer Altria and Prince Bennitri who proved crucial to saving the yarov from an even crueler fate they might have had; as they were the ones who proposed the creation of a barrier between the surface and underground worlds: Siegetev's original plan was, in fact, to purge all traces of Yarvant from Liruzon entirely, and then go after the Far North.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p dir="ltr">
        <span>The barrier ended up being created, sparing the mere thousands of yarov that remained in Liruzon from the fate that had befallen many of their kin, but trapping them in a completely different fate.</span>
      </p>
      <h4>The modern day</h4>
      <p dir="ltr">
        <span>It has been 251 years since these events. While Siegetev's regime was short-lived, in the time afterwards, Rahazun entered a period of decadence, and the later kings and queens never bothered to fix Siegetev's mistakes, only erasing much of his reign fron history. Many refused to send anyone to Ebott at all, as the legend of the mountain's curse stated that people who climbed the mountain would never return. One might have thought it'd be Emperor Sarnelkh who would finally rectify this, had it not been for a certain incident about fifty years ago...</span>
      </p>
      <h4>Khara</h4>
      <p dir="ltr">
        <span>Late in 863 SR, a child, Khara, disappeared from the village of Ri-Ebott, close to the mountain. It was suspected that they climbed the mountain itself in an attempt to disappear. These suspicions were confirmed later, when an unsef emerged from the western entrance of the Ebott cave system and traveled to Ri-Ebott, carrying Khara's dead body. The conclusion was obvious: the yaref, Ondeli, had killed Khara, and taken their SOUL. The people of Ri-Ebott reacted with shock and rage, attacking Ondeli-Khara (Ondeli-Magzi). As with many unsov before and since, Ondeli-Khara was not in unison and refused to fight back, simply leaving the village, injured, and returning to the mountain. This started an anti-yaref sentiment that would persist in the Ri-Ebott jurisdiction, which included Ebott itself, to this day.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p dir="ltr">
        <span>This also started something else: two more children disappeared from the village the following year, and four more in the following five decades, not least sparked by curiosity regarding Khara's disappearance and the later appearance of Ondeli-Khara.</span>

      <h3 class="patchnotes"><em>947, Rahazun</em> </h1>
    <p>
        <!--<span>Emperor Karol-Kalvi Foster was the first emperor of Rahazun after the overthrow of Siegetev Seransai following the war. Most of Karol-Kalvi's reign was spent cleaning up the mess that Siegetev left, but a lot of the history of Yarzon of the Great Watershed got swept up in this. It's not particularly like the following rulers were much better; Lekusa-Kalvi-hin basically did nothing as a ruler, and the issue of Yarzon was far in the past for the following rulers, who wanted to rid themselves of the issue. History recalls one particular instance where a statue of Tomi-Rugan located in Yarhe, originally made in 647 to commemorate Tomi-Rugan and symbolize unity between humans and yarov, was discarded in a pit at Mt. Ebott in 724 during the reign of Ana-Kalvi Foster. One of the people involved in the disposal of the statue, Maniri Lahok, ended up trapped in a chasm in Mt. Ebott due to the barrier; this was a sky-exposed passage largely separated from the main Underground cavern. Maniri died shortly after, and the SOUL was never recovered.</span>

      <h3 class="patchnotes"><em>915, Yarzon-Ebott</em> </h1>
        <h4>From "Conventions"</h4>
        <p>The "X" dating system relates to the standard SR dating system by 663 SR = 1 X (the year following the banishment of the yarov of Liruzon), so that, for example, 201 X is the same year as 863 SR.</p>
        <p>(skipped sections)</p>
        <h4>The aftermath of the war</h4> 
    <p>When we first were trapped in the Underground, we attempted to settle in the most apparently habitable places, among them Upper Waterfall near the surface, the Meadow, and the Snowdin Forest.</p>

<p>In Upper Waterfall, we established Starlight City; in the depths of the Meadow where it transitioned from an open meadow proper to dense jungle, we established the Town of the Wild East, and in the Snowdin Forest, we established the Forest Outpost. For a time, we made the most of the Underground's environments and resources.</p>

<h4>A possible attack?</h4>
<p>That all changed in 61X. We had assumed Altria's deal had spared us from further human attacks, but in 61X, the most powerful of our kind sensed something disturbing. A human had entered the Underground, and we didn't know where. There was only one logical conclusion: the humans were planning incursions into the Underground to destroy what little we had left. Trapped behind the barrier and fearful of further human attacks, we retreated. Far, far into the earth we walked, until we reached the cavern's end. This was our new home, which we named.... "Home". (As great as our king is, he is pretty lousy at names.)<br />
Home became the center of the yaref population, and although the other settlements remained, they were largely left to stand on their own.</p>

<p>When we reached Home, we found another entrance to the cavern, though calling it an "entrance" is rather generous - it was a pit hundreds of meters deep (or, from our perspective, high), a drop that no human could, by any chance, survive; we hardly even acknowledged it was there.</p>
<h4>A mysterious missing human</h4>
<p>But as quick as this mysterious human appeared, it vanished, probably having died - yet when we searched the Underground for remains or a SOUL, no traces could be found. The only thing we found was a mysterious stone statue of Tomi-Rugan, probably from the old city outside the barrier - how it ended up here is a complete mystery - more recently, we have discovered that there is a hidden crack leading to the surface that was more than big enough for the statue to slide through, but that still leaves the question of "why" wide open. Perhaps humans were trying to erase all traces that we ever existed.</p>
<h4>The mystery, solved</h4>
<p>It was not until several decades later in 116X that we, in fact, found the opening, and realized that that human's entry into the barrier was simply happenstance - however, both the body and the SOUL had long since decayed (even human SOULs slowly decay if not stored properly). This combined with further info on human culture led us to realize that following the war, humans in fact meant us no harm - in fact, there was a growing movement among the human population to actually free us from the Underground. As such, fearing the humans no longer, we moved out of our old city, Home. We braved  harsh cold, damp swampland, and searing heat - but it was actually a much slower process than what one might have thought - until we reached what we now call our capital. It was still the Starlight City to start off with, but over the next century, it and many other settlements would grow dramatically, and the Starlight City would eventually be renamed "New Home". (Again, our king is really bad at names...?) Additionally, the Steamworks was built near the Meadow to power such a massively expanded domain.</p>

<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>917, Ri-Ebott</em> </h1>
    <p>A barrier (pg.146, Altria) is a field enclosing a region of space, which prevents beings with weak SOULs from exiting. Additional effects include:<br />
        - While within the barrier, powerful beings can manipulate timelines in a manner similar to a video game save file (pg. 236, Alfizo)<br />
        A barrier can only be destroyed by the equivalent power used to create it.<br />
        According to Alfizo's studies, an average human would not be able to cross a barrier created by ~7 souls, but this is not supported by accounts by Kaizo, who claims to have crossed such a barrier alone while being weaker than the average human in terms of "DETERMINATION" and other metrics, though due to the "SAVE" phenomenon from before, this is unverifiable.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, Kaizo claims that while within a barrier, the will to destroy, as characterized by Arfia and Alfizo's "LV" metric, has a much greater physical effect. Although this is also an unverified claim because of the "SAVE", it could explain the abnormal prominence of Khara's identity in Kaizo.</p>

        <h1 id="e5">From <em>A Specification on the Properties of Yahir, and on the Historical Concepts of Hope and Determination</em> </h1>
        <h3 class="patchnotes"><em>918, Yarzon-Ebott</em> </h1>
          <h4>Conventional wisdom</h4> 
        <p>
            <span>According to ancient Yarzona wisdom, humans and yarov possessed two complementary inherent qualities to their nature: "determination" in humans and  "hope" in yarov. While determination is roughly what you'd expect, 'hope' referred to a more general set of qualities including compassion, in an extreme extent. Both of these, when embodied in the same being to great extent, would unlock the potential for anything to be possible. Both qualities, according to the belief, were actually embodied in all beings, though in their opposite type to a comparatively very small extent. Notably, a term translating to "boss monster" was used to describe yarov who were seen as having a small amount of determination, but later shifted to refer to the set of yaref types which consistently exhibited this property. Due to their nature in this model, boss monsters were often chosen as leaders for the yaref realms.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>Like much conventional wisdom, it wasn't right, but not exactly wrong either. Based on the findings of Ketsukane in regards to SOUL manipulation, Alfizo et al. were able to trace the phenomenon of persistent SOULs, associated with humans and less strongly with boss monsters, to a measurable and alterable aspect of SOULs, which was labeled "determination".</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>A long time before, hope was noted to be simply an exhibition of a more general phenomenon regarding yahir itself, and to not be a "real" metaphysical concept.</span>
          </p>
          <h4>Unsov</h4> 
          <p>
            <span>A being with both determination and hope in large amounts was called an unsef. Despite the obsoletion of the 'hope' model (although the characteristic power of yarov is distinct, 'hope' as a quality is inaccurate), the term in more modern times (given the obsoletion of the 'hope' model) refers to a being with both yaref and human SOULs. Unsov are possible, but rare: either a yaref has to absorb a human SOUL, or a human has to absorb a rare kind of yaref SOUL. A third, more artificial method was discovered by Alfizo, involving the physical forcing of determination into a yaref's body, but this results in extremely unstable beings. (Note that a soulless being such as a yaref reincarnated using determination can absorb both kinds of souls.) While they are technically unsov by the traditional definition, their discovery and marked differences from conventional unsov has resulted in a more precise definition of an unsef as a being with both human and yaref SOULs.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>Both beings become conscious within the unsef, and this usually limits the unsef's power pretty heavily (as has happened with all unsov in history). A more  powerful unsef can suppress the motives of the other included beings, but that suppression can be easily foiled by a small amount of experience with something associated with the absorbed being's identity. This most famously happened with Ondeli, the prince of Ebott.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>However, an unsef with motives fully aligned would hold unfathomable power - reality and the world would bend to their will, and pretty much anything would be possible for the unsef. It is likely that the 'SAVE' phenomenon associated with the barrier is a low-level manifestation of this, as a human picks up the ambient yahir power associated with being within a barrier. While an unsef's main actor.is able to suppress other included beings, this often takes up to 6 or 7 human souls' worth of power, and if the other beings actively fight against the unsef, this suppression is broken. </span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>Unsov have existed prior to Ondeli-Magzi, and in fact their presence began ramping up rapidly from the early 600s, however they all were similarly mutually checked. It is the appearance of a moderately more powerful unsef, Tomi-Rugan, from 647 to 661 that ultimately led to the Invasion of Yarzon-Watershed, where the unsef was taken as a threat, was defeated, and the remaining yarov were forced out of surface Liruzon. (It is, in fact, Tomi-Rugan, that was depicted in Waterfall.)</span>

            </p>
            
            <p>
              <span>It has been known since the beginning of Ana-hin's formal ambassadorship in 256X that the name Khara took while in the Underground was "Magzi"; this is because of the body-sharing of Ana-hin and Khara allowing the latter to interact in the world directly; the power by which this body-sharing was able to occur is unknown.</span>

            <p><strong>From "Myalvi":</strong></p>
            <p><span>Tur-Myalvi is a nation of Wilant located south of Rahazun and north of Hesan proper. Tur-Myalvi was founded when the wilo came across the sea from Endadvi, establishing their rule over what was once the northern realm of Hesan (ruled by Niki). They failed to understand the Panavana as a people, failing to recognize the natural place of different kinds of people in Hesanic society, while the Panavic people were... [...] ...and as a result, after the original colonial program failed, in a crude attempt to integrate with existing cultures, the nation of Tur-Myalvi adopted the Esteri deity <em>Errai</em> as a national symbol (while still of course continuing to worship Hierrau, their own god), not realizing that Errai in Esteri mythology was a demon of boredom and confusion, associated with Myalvi by the ezov to mock Wilant.</span></p>

              </div>
              
              <p>The months alternate 37 and 38 days, and are close to (but not exactly) the lunar cycle of about 33 days. So, Ilgimer is 38 days long, then Minovi is 37 days, and so on. Not part of any month is Arvendanula, the day at the end of the year after Gazeki and before Ilgimer of the next year. In a leap year, this becomes 1 Arvendanula and 2 Arvendanula (the festivities are held on the 2nd day, with the first day being preparations similar to the role of 38 Gazeki in a normal year).</p>
              
              <p>The four seasons are caused by the tilt of Yona's axis relative to the orbital plane. As the planet orbits, which parts of the planet get more light changes. When a hemisphere is facing the Sun, it is summer in that hemisphere and winter in the other (which is facing away). In the northern hemisphere, the summer solstice occurs on 1 Njuimer, and the winter solstice occurs on Arvendanula (though the actual dates vary back and forth by about a day due to leap years and other factors). </p>
              
              <p>In between the solstices are the equinoxes, the spring equinox at 1 Minaha and the autumn equinox at 1 Gazaha, when neither hemisphere is pointed towards the Sun and so days and nights are of equal length.</p>

              <p>
                  <span>The Panavana did not believe, as the Yekherabe or Ezov did, that creativity and inspiration came from within oneself. They treated the voices in their heads as higher beings, intimately connected with each one of them and calling out to them with inspiration. To the higher being, the human served as a way to transmit their ideas into the world - the presence of such a higher being (henceforth an "urbax") associated with a person is, to them, what defined consciousness. </span>

                <p>
                  <span>Those with powerful imaginations, often to the point of delusion, were valued within their culture, as it implied the urbax's role was much more absolute in these people than in others. One particular individual of Halaj, Iradanet, was seen as having entirely been consumed by her urbax. Iradanet lived entirely in the mental space, only acting in the real world to (barely) maintain her body, and to speak to those who came to her. She rejected basically anything physical, except an amount of food and drink barely enough to keep her alive.</span>

                <p>
                  <span>Now, it is important to note that to take as a conclusion that all Panavana wished to meet this ideal is to extraneously impose Myalvi's notion of being "neurotypical" on the Panavic culture. Of course, people like Iradanet were spiritually significant, but more grounded individuals were necessary for keeping society running, and individuals of all different mindforms found their place in society - mindform was as much a suggestion of societal role as gender was, and a much more sensible one at that.</span>

                <h4>Hesan</h4> 
                <p>
                  <span>The many Panavic realms founded in Old Liruzon by 790 BF (in a land they called "Hesan") included Halaj, Tatak, Herm, Heksi, and Rovana. Of these, the last would grow to be particularly dominant. Hesan was ultimately united under Rovana by 767 BF, and the people of Hesan began to invade the lands to the north, driving out the native Vanki. But from the Vanki, they took stories and legends, adapting them to fit what they believed. One of these was the story of Koratar, a child who became lost in the forest and was raised by animals. Eventually, when faced with a choice of whether to return to the human world, Koratar chose to stay in the wilderness as an adventurer.</span>
                </p>
                
                <h4>Koratar and the Gordrivi</h4> 
                
                <p>
                  <span>Koratar's story came to serve as inspiration for those of the northern reaches of Hesan who were rejected by civilization - by 687 BF, they would form a new tribe, the Gordrivi (Koratar's people - the modern form of Koratar is </span>
                  <em>
                    <span>Goradar</span>

                  <span>), living in the forest away from the established Panavana domain. While the Gordrivi as a people were subsumed into later empires, some of their practices carried on, and a revitalization effort is currently underway.</span>

                <p>
                  <span>Meanwhile, Hesan expanded throughout the South, conquering the cities of Natrin and Jovel, and settling Avenur by 630 BF. </span>
                </p>
                
          <h4>Government and culture</h4> 
                
                <p>
                  <span>Hesan was an elective monarchy, much like many of its Panavic successors. As an empire, Hesan had a central government that ruled over a number of semi-autonomous "counties", which is also a system that persists into the modern day in some form or another. Hesan referred to its own ruler as </span>
                  <em>
                    <span>nie </span>
                  </em>
                  <span>and the rulers of other countries (and of its counties) as </span>
                  <em>
                    <span>niki</span>
                  </em>
                  <span>. It is </span>
                  <em>
                    <span>niki </span>
                  </em>
                  <span>that is now the modern term for "king" or "queen", as few countries were recognized as true successors to the Hesanic empire.</span>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  <span>In Hesan, and especially in the northern reaches, names were only given to legendary figures or otherwise posthumously; for the identification of individuals, simple descriptions of roles, relations, or characteristics were sufficient, which were often context-dependent and unable to formalize into a system of names consequently (except in the aforementioned case).  </span>
                </p>
              <h4>Division of the empire</h4> 
                <p>
                  <span>By 479 BF, Hesan had entered its later years as an empire. This was the year a new king was chosen to rule the nation. He was thirty-five years old. At eighty-five (in 449), this king, now known as Kari, attempted to overrule the electoral council's decision so that his son would take the throne instead. This led to a great division in the country: the electorate and the appointed ruler fled to the north, while the south remained in the hands of a now hereditary regime under Kari's son. The rulers of the North were only identified as </span>
                  <em>
                    <span>niki</span>
                  </em>
                  <span> (a fact that has made tracking the dynastic history of the northern realm very challenging). We have determined that the founder and first ruler, "Niki-hin", ruled from 449 to ~400 BF.</span>
                </p>
          
          <h4>Rulers of the south</h4> 
                
                <p>
                  <span>The south began to formalize names at this point, especially for distinguished individuals (i.e. the king), so tracking the dynastic history is a little easier, though names at this point were essentially formalized descriptions. The name of the first king, Ardik, essentially meant either "mountain prince" (with "prince" being -ik, a contracted form of </span>
                  <em>
                    <span>niki</span>
                  </em>
                  <span>), or, according to recent reconstructions, was a northern insult meaning "little lazy one" (mainly because it is unclear how n- in niki would have been lost). We also know that this was the first of two leaders of the southern realm, with the second being called Sana. </span>
                </p>
                
          <h4>Sana and the fall of the south</h4> 
                
                <p>
                  <span>The core Panavic region had also established an empire, Panavis, at this point, whose expansion began encroaching on Southern territory from 423 BF. The new queen Sana fought back, but this started a long war with Panavis which stretched on several decades. By 396 BF, most of the southern realm was overrun, and Sana had retreated to a small town to the west of the capital Vard. It is here where she was slain, and the war won by the forces of Panavis. Thus, the town in later times became known as Sana's Stand. Traditional knowledge holds that here she said [insert oddly poetic line], but records from the people accompanying her suggest that it was a simple expression of frustration or disappointment - essentially, "F*ck."</span>

                <p>
                  <span>It would not be long before the north, too, fell - strange hooded people from across the sea first arrived on the shores in 387 BF. They simply wished to engage in trade, but they did not seem to respect the inhabitants of the northern reaches as people, making no effort to understand the concepts we took for granted, and imposing their own customs upon us. But it came to a head in 247 BF when they attempted to directly impose their rule upon the northern reaches, which they had called </span>
                  <em>
                    <span>Myalvi</span>
                  </em>
                  <span> along with their primary settlement there, from which they drove out the original inhabitants. Their plans had been to establish their own "country" stretching from coast to coast, south to Rovana and north to Ester. With their superior technology, it took the forces of all of Liruzon combined to even attempt to drive them out, but ultimately the key factor in doing them in was their own instability, as growing discontent in the invading population led them to completely separate from whatever kingdom they originated from. Vilant's invasion had been halted, but at the cost of the northern realm of Hesan. While the southern territories would eventually gain independence, and, being under a Panavic rule, had been relatively unharmed, the north was forever scarred by the vilo, whose continuing presence on the continent, even if severely weakened, was terrifying to many. As a result, vilo have not been well-respected in Liruzon, though more recent attempts at resolving this have been fruitful.</span>

                    <span>Ramazir, or Ek-Ramazir, is the god of the night sky and the giver of wisdom in Estero-Korahai mythology. Ramazir's domain naturally extends to navigation for the maritime Monteraga people, as Monteraga sailors look to the stars for guidance when traveling the seas between Montera and Ezvelan. Like the gods of Ester in general, Ramazir is treated as an immaterial yet still anthropomorphic figure; his home is the heavens above the clouds.</span>

The festival Arvendanula, held on the winter solstice, is named after Arvent. Traditions include the exchange of gifts, family activities, singing songs, etc. Usually, it is the additional role of a chosen accomplished person in the community to distribute gifts to community members; this is done in Arvent's name. </span>

    <span>When those of Ramazir proposed the Great Evacuation, one would have been quick to perceive it as illogical and impractical. But we were desperate - searching for any way to save our people, and despite involving uprooting our entire kingdom and abandoning the Watershed, the Evacuation seemed to be our best option. (At this point, we did not yet know of Altria's deal.) Plus, we knew that the leaders of Montera were working behind the back of Ilant - in our favor - for the entire war up to this point, so it was only correct to go through with the plan.</span>
</p>
                    
    <p>
         <span>And what a plan it was. Montera suspended pretty much all normal government operation to support this. It was perhaps three hundred ships total, with thousands of monsters on board each, all sailing northwards across the great Sea of Montera to reach Ezvelan. The plan had been negotiated with Ester and with the original Yarzon there, and they were willing to accept us.</span>

<p>Schooling typically begins the first day (1 Ilgimer) of the calendar year after a child turns seven years old. The school year itself is split into four terms: winter*, spring*, summer*, and fall*. </p>

<p>*Note that these do not comply with the common definitions of the seasons.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Each term lasts for two months, less three weeks to allow for a 24-day break between terms (school days cancelled due to weather or other concerns may be compensated for here) (totalling 97 or 98 days throughout the year). This means that there are precisely 204 school days in a given year.</p>

<p>A child graduates primary school after completing Year 8, usually at 14 or 15 years old, and then moves onto secondary education, which provides a more personalized approach to learning, allowing the child to receive certifications in a chosen field of study.</p>

<p>Secondary education is technically optional, but the vast majority of people attend secondary school for either another 4 or 8 years following completing Year 8.</p>

<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>913, Monselian</em> </h1>
<p>
    <span>In the society of Panavis, there have historically been two kinds of worker: compensated workers and servants. Compensated workers are hired into their positions and receive compensation for their work. Servants are several categories of workers (public servants and household servants) that are socially expected to work despite not being paid, and usually originate from various defined role categories considered best suited for their purpose. Public servants include farm workers, the military, and some other mass labor, as well as various categories of public utility positions (generally serving the state), while household servants work for a single person or a household. The kinds of servants are considered the lowest class in a vertical arrangement - this characterizes their lack of authority, but also position as the essential bedrock that ensures the stable functioning of society. Also, note that there is social mobility available, especially in more recent times.</span>
  </p>
  <h4>Modern support systems</h4>
  <p>
    <span>In recent times, there has been a massive push for equality. As of 913, servants still exist, but they often receive large amounts of state support, in order to provide the opportunity for them to live the life they want. This includes laws about treatment of servants,  state-backed financial support, and laws protecting workers in general. Public servants are still distinct from compensated workers (who work for a particular company or person, and are paid directly from there), but in most places in modern times, household servants have merged with compensated workers (in fact, the term "compensated worker" is now rather dated in most places) - Farnitan remains an exception. </span>

    <span>...[Yarov] are manifestations of yahir (the part of the natural world relating to patterns and concepts) that are themselves not only sentient, but sapient. The yaref populations originate by the localized influence of human concepts, causing yarov to appear in the region (hence explaining their similarity to an idealized form of human sociality). This is a passive effect, as humans do not possess the capacity to directly induce yarov. But yarov themselves, being natively yahiric, </span>

This also explains their general impressionability in some contexts to humans (in specific, when they are not opposed), and thus the large-scale borrowing of Rahazuna and Totijona cultural concepts throughout early history, and additionally, accounts seem to describe certain cases of friendly human social interaction as "an aura of peaceful DETERMINATION"...</span>

<h1 id="e15">From <em>Profile: Arfia-hin</em> </h1>
<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>920, Yarzon-Ebott</em> </h1>
<p>Arfia-hin was the de-facto Royal Scientist between 234X and 246X, continuing Gaster's research into alternate timelines.<br />
</p>
 <h4>Origin</h4>

<p>Arfia-hin, a skeleton-like yaref, was born in 229X, ambiently manifesting in then-Royal-Scientist Maik-Mespir Gaster's lab. Gaster raised Arfia-hin after this point, and Arfia-hin quickly began to contribute to Gaster's research, befriending Alfi Alfizo who would later become the official Royal Scientist, and later on, another skeleton Kobzo-hin (who appeared shortly after Arfia-hin) and the human Okhelai would join the family group; Kobzo-hin was Arfia-hin's brother, or formally his BEST FRIEND.</p>
    
    <p>Given the unusual circumstances of Arfia-hin's manifestation, as well as his unusual "karma" ability and him and his brother's unusual physiology, he had generally assumed he was from some other reality himself, and had been unknowingly transported to the world he currently resided in without his original memories (he had chosen his name, "without", in reference to this).</p>
    
    <h4>Gaster's death</h4>
    
    <p>Late in Gaster's life, Gaster spent much of his time on studying alternate timelines and parallel worlds, which would ultimately lead to his disappearance along with Okhelai's death in 234X, at which point Arfia-hin and Dr. Alfizo continued Gaster's research. Their reports showed timelines jumping left and right, stopping and starting. Eventually, the models' predictions ended, revealing that an urbax at some point would have the ability to control timelines. Alfizo began to shift focus to SOUL power when she got unexpectedly appointed as Royal Scientist following the original abolition of the position.</p>
    
    <h4>Later life</h4>
    
    <p>While he doubted his original theory about his origin by this point (partially due to the emergence of a large population of skeletons in the Underground in the intervening time) he had regardless incorporated it into his personal narrative as a revelation, and as such he attempted to continue work on a machine Gaster had designed but never finished, intended to contact other universes. However, the design was fundamentally flawed and never ended up working, so he eventually gave up.</p>
    
    <p>After this, Arfia-hin took two jobs: one as a sentry for the Royal Guard (along the same path as his BEST FRIEND/brother Kobzo-hin, who wished to become a Royal Guard member himself), and another as a performer at the MTT Resort.</p>
    
    <h4>Ana-hin</h4>
    
    <p>Arfia was one of the people who befriended the human Ana-hin and as a result played a key role in the breaking of the barrier in 251X. Currently as of 258X, Arfia works with human scientific organizations which share an interest in the nature of reality itself, and remains friends with Ana-hin.</p>
    
<h4>Difficulty</h4>

    <p>According to Khara, Arfia-hin is "extremely difficult". This is difficult to understand, though it is likely to do with a general period of hostile revelation to Ana-hin throughout and shortly after their time in the Underground.</p>

    <span>The gold piece (G) is the common currency of Liruzon, which as of 915 is currently roughly valued at 0.27 Ezvelan dollars or 0.11 Tur-Myalvi shillings, such that a gram of gold costs 4,000 G (until 913, the realm of Yarzon-Ebott used a different gold piece which was valued at about half that amount); for more common-place things, a loaf of bread is approximately 20 G, a cup of tea is approximately 30 G, and a night in a hotel room is approximately 100 G.</span>
  </p>
  
<h4>Preliminaries</h4>
  
  <p>
    <span>The history of the gold piece began with the standardization of currency by the empire of Niderazon in 31 SR. Prior to this, the predecessor to the gold piece was actual golden coins, which were, as ten grams of gold, roughly 40,000 modern G, and thus only used for large purchases; the use of gold in this manner predated metallurgy.</span>
  </p>
  
<h4>Gold and the sun</h4>
  
  <p>
    <span>The metal gold was associated with the sun (as copper was associated with the moon; see this excerpt from Liudai's work </span>
    <em>
      <span>On The Sun, Moon, Planets, and Stars (497 BF, Hesan)</span>
    </em>
    <span>: )</span>
  </p><div class="infocontainer">
  

  
  <p>
      <span>First, by brightness, are the Moon and the Sun, the Copper and the Golden. Then, the four planets, the Wanderers of the night sky: Haida (the morning and evening star) which may also be called Zia, and also Falari, Yaseo, and Andrae (note Andrae's blue color). Then there is the eye of Ramazir, visible in summer nights (it is located in the Silver Path area), and then the lesser stars (the brightest of which being Lohuda, Lohamari, and the stars of the Antadel-Karan visible in the fall).</span>
    </p>
  
</div>
  
<h4>The origin of G</h4>

  <p>
    <span> The first gold coins minted by Niderazon retained the value of the earlier gold coins, but were much larger for convenience and were thus made of cheaper metals plated with gold. In the later Niderazon era as of the 3rd century, this was changed to brass as the tie to gold was changed from the direct composition of the coin to a formal valuing of the currency, allowing for the smaller coins to be valued at consistent fractions of the gold piece, most notably the penny at 1/120 G.</span>
  </p>
  

  <h4>The king's gold</h4>
  <p>
    <span>During Niderazon's decline in the 6th century, the "true gold" (</span>
    <em>
      <span>sonfodrund</span>
    </em>
    <span>) money was changed to "king's gold" (</span>
    <em>
      <span>niegadrund</span>
    </em>
    <span>), now being given value by the state as opposed to deriving its value from some amount of precious metal; as a result, its value declined rapidly over the following decades, before stabilizing in many economies at roughly 25 modern gold pieces (after Niderazon's fall, and thus as the </span>
    <em>
      <span>nikigadrund </span>
    </em>
    <span>or "prince's gold") and slowly declining from there. </span>
  </p>
    <h4>Modern times</h4>
  <p><br />
  <span>In recent times, the penny was retired, and the gold piece was standardized by the major economic center Farnitan (resulting in the "common gold" or </span>
    <em>
      <span>ginzonindrund</span>
    </em>
    <span>). The Invasion of Yarzon-Watershed also caused a separation between Yarzon-Ebott's economy and the general economy of the wider world, causing the value of its gold piece to drop further. However, after 913, Yarzon-Ebott adopted the standard gold piece. In Yarzon-Ezvelan, after 662 SR and the Great Evacuation, the gold piece was adopted as legal tender despite the proximity to and interaction with Ezvanta economies which use the dollar.</span>

<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>923, Rahazun</em> </h1>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>Many things in the world follow hard and fast rules, mostly in the realm of the very small and very large. The moon always goes around the earth, which always goes around the sun. Gravity pulls a person down to the ground, and white light can be split into a rainbow of colors.</p>



<p>But there are many things in the world that don't follow hard rules, but are more... general. These are the things we notice in our day to day lives. Animals respond to eclipses by preparing for nighttime. Leaves turn red in the autumn (or perhaps leaves turning red defines autumn), and snow falls in the winter (or perhaps snowfall defines winter). One might break their legs when landing from a bad fall, and a rainbow might be seen as beautiful. A cat or dog might be excited for its owner to come home, and a child might not eat their vegetables. Societies engage in alliance and warfare. People come up with ideas, and express them.</p>

<h4>Yahir to Yarov</h4>

<p>These things do not follow rules, but rather patterns and associations. And that is the essence of <em> yahir </em> . Note that many of these are the result of thought and communication (in fact, human interaction is one of the largest contributors by far to the ambient yahiric flux). Yahir is the manifestation of things based on what patterns they follow. What they're associated with. And thus it only makes sense for some of these manifestations to themselves be like humans in some regards, or like the beings humans come up with (hence a common association with " <em> monsters </em>") - thinking, talking, believing, creating, caring for one another. (Note that these are not direct manifestations of human concepts, as that is an idea unique to the Ilgiric context which is unsuitable to explain yarov. Instead, think of it like waves in a pond, making interference patterns that are completely different to their original sources.)</p>

<h4>The characteristics of yarov</h4>

<p>A manifestation of that kind is a <em> yaref, </em>and its essence can be thought of as projecting from a "SOUL" contained within it, a reflection of sapience and social morality in both humans and yarov. Yarov appear as many different kinds of things, ranging from objects, to animals, to appearances that are rather similar to humans, and in general, yarov may be sorted into several dozen "types" per population. Yarov are generally much weaker physically than humans, and are often rather impressionable to humans and other things around them, taking after social environments they interact with. On the other side, if attacked with the intent to kill, they are severely injured and often die on the spot. When a yaref dies, the SOUL and its projection is lost and the remaining ambient physical matter in the form disperses into the world (although the physical matter within a yaref contains a "signature" of the yaref's identity, much as that comprising a human does). </p>

<h4>Human SOULs</h4>

<p>Meanwhile, human SOULs are disjoint from their physicality, and enter an inactive state upon death before gradually decaying over time, unless "absorbed" by a yaref, an uncommon but notable practice in societies where humans and yarov regularly interact. This re-ignites the human's consciousness within the same body as the yaref, and the two together compose an unsef, an extremely powerful being that, at its strongest, could bend the world to its will (though in practice, all unsov are significantly limited in their power by the presence of two minds within them). An unsef is conventionally referred to by the hyphenated names of the monster and human(s).</p>



<p>This distinction - this <em> DETERMINATION </em>- that separates a human's SOUL from its body, when forced into monsters, causes them to, upon "death", shed the physical matter giving their forms coherence, reverting to vague, shifting, and illusory states formed by pure yahir. </p>

<h4>Additional notes</h4>

<p>Yahir is also used to influence other aspects of the way people live - yarov sustain their energy by eating yahiric food, which can also sustain humans, though to an extent unsuitable for being a sole source of sustenance (though note the exceptional case of the Yahiraban), and yahir can be used to harm and heal. </p>


<p>Because of the way yarov originate, and them being very naturally proficient in manipulating yahir directly, yarov can actually create new yaref individuals, and thus they can propagate their populations and act as a form of "life".</p>
<h1 id="e18">From <em>Yarzon-Watershed</em> </h1>
<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>921, Rahazun</em> </h1>
<p>
    <span>Many of the ways humans relate to "nature" relate to the nature and behavior of yarov. Especially in Panavic culture, the first full-scale cases where humans interacted with yarov as people (as opposed to phenomena, and excluding small-scale ambient manifestations) come from the lingering populations brought about by the practices of the Vanki.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><br />
  <span>These manifested at first the nation of </span>
    <em>
      <span>A-Yahiraveli-Fadhmar </span>
    </em>
    <span>(in modern times </span>
    <em>
      <span>A-Fadami</span>
    </em>
    <span>), which eventually spread out to the numerous realms of Yarvant, as far north as </span>
    <em>
      <span>A-Yahiraveli-Devarak</span>
    </em>
    <span> (which we now simply call Yarzon or Yarzon-Ezvelan) and as far west as </span>
    <em>
      <span>A-Yahiraveli-Lundroz</span>
    </em>
    <span> (which is often rendered in modern Liruzona as "Yarzon of the Watershed"). Lundroz was the main group to interact with the Panavana. The legendary rulers Aratikent of Lundroz and Etevni of Hesan promised that they together (and thus humans and yarov together) would rule over the world, and for a time after Etevni's death, Unsef Etevni-Aratikent would rule over both kingdoms until Aratikent's death and the succession of Etevni by Nienon (and Aratikent by Porakate). Their alliance, while it only formally lasted as long as the Empire of Hesan, would continue to recur in cultural interactions up until it was shattered by the Invasion of Yarzon-Watershed.</span>
  </p>
<h1 id="e19">From <em>Guide to Common Knowledge - Preface</em> </h1>
<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>915, Hesan</em> </h1>
<p>
    <span>The concept of the Guide to Common Knowledge originated in 721 in a revelation to Jezen Dekirzo, one of the major contributors to the idea of what we now call primary education in Liruzon.
        Jezen noticed that his child, Ravi Jezenzo, was consistently having to have basic aspects of the world and the surrounding societal workings explained to them. 
        While this was expected for the given mindform (a literalist perceptually proficient branch), a better solution was warranted to handle that case more effectively, 
        and so he spent many years studying the kinds of things people end up having to teach their children, observing the world from the perspective of a child who is 
        unfamiliar with its workings, and making use of comparisons to the radically different nearby culture of Myalvi, in order to compile the first edition of the Guide to Common Knowledge,
         which was the basis for the very first primary curriculum. It has been revised over the years as both our understanding of the world and our culture evolved, and the modern 
         "Common Knowledge" course found in every primary school is ultimately based on the original Guide. </span>
  </p>


  <h1 id="e20">From <em>The Fort Karzen Files</em> </h1>
  <h3 class="patchnotes"><em>267 BF, Tur Myalvi</em> </h1>
  <p>
    <span>Those already living in the lands of Myalvi do not have a firm grasp on reality as it is, often deriving knowledge from their fictions rather than from the truth. This is because their form of "consciousness" is fundamentally flawed; they think of themselves as, if they don't actually be, inherently non-conscious, receiving inspiration only from higher sources. This is reflected in how they often (seemingly irrationally) place people with debilitating mental disorders in prestigious positions. They additionally regularly violate the sanctity of sexual relations; their marriage customs are not fully understood and seem to deviate from romantic love in many situations; this implies a broken form of morality, one which does not respect any traditional form of formality whatsoever. They additionally lack any sort of reasonable structure to their leadership, answering to local lords who then answer to their greater leaders. The natives of Myalvi are a harsh, warlike people, who refuse to follow the faith of Hierrau; we have encountered resistance from native armies on all fronts during colonization, though we have managed to hold onto our fortifications near the Sevevda River (namely, Fort Sevevda itself along with Fort Karzen and Fort Ruerden). </span>
  </p>

<h1 id="e21">From <em>The Rahazuna Political System</em> </h1>
<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>904, Rahazun</em> </h1>

  <p>
  <span>The Emperor of Rahazun (currently Sarnelkh) rules over the empire of Rahazun. The counties comprising the Empire are each ruled by a Count who answers to the Emperor, with the Count of Rahazun County serving a replacement role if the Emperor is away or unable to rule. At the bottom level, there are the Chiefs of each city or ward, which answer to their Count and to the Emperor. This means that the Golden City itself (Ezref) has three rulers:</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Emperor Sarnelkh Seransai of the Rahazuna Empire</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Count Erevornu Seransai of Rahazun County</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Chief Lurazi Telibaz of Ezref</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>There is additionally the role of "viscount", which is equivalent to a count in rank but does not rule. However, this generally only serves a transitional purpose when a county is split or merged, acting as a way for a previous ruler to shift into a new position once the change is finalized, and as a result the role is rare.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>In some cases, individual counts can informally change their allegiance - an example of this is Count Dalnun of Montera during the Invasion of Yarzon-Watershed, who formally answered to Siegetev but instead supported the nation of Yarzon-Watershed during the war, and sided with Ester more generally - they couldn't directly intervene in the war, but they could make way for the Great Evacuation, allowing 99% of Yarzon-Watershed's surviving population to make it to a new Yarzon in the north. More formally, such as in cases of conquest, division, or union, local governments are essentially "snipped off" and attached to a different higher-rank government, or made independent, as was the case with Rahazun's independence from Niderazon in 572. </span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The Emperor is elected by a council, which also has the right to declare an Emperor unfit for rule since 663.</span>
</p>
<h1 id="e22">From <em>University of Monselian</em> </h1>
<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>913, Rahazun</em> </h1>
<p>
  <span>The U.M. is believed by some to be the reason Rahazun grew from the small village of Rafi's settlers to the bustling metropolis it is today. In 435 SR during Rahazun's allegiance to Niderazon, a mysterious figure known as the Historian arrived in Rahazun County from the northern lands of El-Sarvin, and established the University of Monselian, which would become the most important center of knowledge for Liruzon as a whole. Many people came to the University to study, and thus Monselian, and hence Rahazun. </span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The boost in cultural influence and social power that Rahazun County received as a result of this eventually allowed it to become independent of Niderazon, establishing its own political sphere by 572 SR. </span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The Historian themself is generally taken to be an immortal servant of Ramazir, as the Historian as an identity is still existent today. Physical appearances of the Historian have been extremely rare. However, many books have been published by the University in the Historian's name. In the baseline interpretation, the Historian is a persona maintained by the University, similar to the various appearances of Arvent during the winter holidays for their respective communities.</span>

<h1 id="e24">From <em>The Kinds of Human</em> </h1>
<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>892, Yarzon-il-Dividar</em> </h1>
<p>Unlike yarov which may have dozens of kinds within the same settlement, and hundreds more elsewhere, humans only have a handful of different regional varieties, often with distinct cultures. Cultural differences between these ethnicities' respective cultures will be covered separately; for now, we will focus on the physical distinctions between them. Consult the introduction to this book for a primer on human physiology.</p>

<p>Vedil, the most commonly found in Liruzon, are among the taller varieties of humans, about 7 feet tall on average with a wide, heavy body type and a distinctive yellow skin tone. They are also notable for their late onset of puberty (from about 18 to 25 years old) relative to their lifespan of about 80 years.</p>

<p>Razil are another common human variety native to the caverns beneath Liruzon. They belong to a family of related cave-dwelling human populations that share the characteristics of pale skin tones, very short and scrawny body types, and hunched postures, including the Yahiraban native to the caverns underneath the Vana, and the Tadeleti living in Ezvelan.</p>

<p>Donno are the original natives to Liruzon, as the Vanki population which has been forced further east by Panavic expansion. Physically, Donno are of medium height and body type, with feline ears and tail. Notably, they mature extremely quickly for their lifespan of about 73 years.</p>

<p>Ezov call the snowy lands of Ezvelan home, and are well-adapted to it, with thick fur and dark skin that serve to trap and absorb heat. They are somewhat shorter than donno, but not as short as razil. They have unusually short lifespans, only up to about 50 years, and as such mature rather quickly.</p>

<p>Wilo, a variety native to Indadvi but now also found in Tur-Myalvi and rarely elsewhere in Liruzon, are of medium height, with skin ranging from tan to pale beige, and a medium body type, however they customarily hide their appearances with cloaks. Their lifespans are on the longer side, similarly to vedil. </p>

<p>Pavriz are an example of a kind of human living in the far east of Iltezon, in the lands of Havon and also to the south in Inveri. They are very tall (8-9 feet) with a generally skinny body type, and with skin ranging from light red to light purple and dark eyes. They live up to 100 years, but are only fully grown by about age 35.</p>

<p>Malakiz live across Iltezon as a diaspora, in various small settlements within other cities, in traveling bands, etc. Physically, they resemble wila children (in fact, puberty/adolescence doesn't affect their external appearance at all), with reddish skin tones, and they live for about 90 years on average.</p>

<h1 id="e25">From a meeting between Altria and Bennitri</h1>
<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>663, Rahazun</em> </h1>

<p>
  <span>Benni: "Your goal is to get Yarvant out of your sight, correct?"</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Altria: "Yes, that is exactly the case. Siegetev demands we ensure the yarov pose no risk to humanity."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Benni: "Understood. I believe that that could be made so without eradicating the entirety of Yarvant. It would pain me greatly to see Ruaeli and Nanara killed, and the haven of Yarzon-Ezvelan attacked, and while we have already sorely violated Etevni's alliance, we should not make things worse for no reason."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Altria: "As it turns out, the death of Yarvant is not what I want either. But Siegetev is like no king we have had before, and won't take 'no' for an answer. If his lineage didn't make it obvious otherwise, I would assume he is an agent of Hierrau intending to inflict its chosen leadership on our own."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Benni: "Yes, it is indeed Siegetev who is the issue. I had indeed also assumed Myalvi had infiltrated Rahazun by some manner before I saw him in person, especially given Myalvi's involvement in the war."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Altria: "That being said, though, I have been workshopping a solution. A barrier, tuned to keep yarov contained while allowing humans to pass freely."</span>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span>Benni: "If it means that the remnants of the yarov of the Watershed are spared, then I will accept it."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Altria: "Yes. And again, keep in mind that whatever facsimile of service Siegetev attempts to provide is not eternal; he may claim an aspiration to purge Yarvant from Ezvelan, but this will not come to pass. Dissent is already mounting; change is soon to come. It's just a shame you lot were unable to hold out long enough."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Altria: "Oh, and one more thing, in case this is relevant."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Benni: "Yes?"</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Altria: "I have been thinking about the location of this barrier. We need a concentrated space that it would be easy to coerce the yaref population into, so it needs to be a defined region relatively close to the strongholds of Yarhe. Additionally, for my purposes (and thus yours), it needs to be significantly isolated such that leading a further attack into it is infeasible. The only location that meets these criteria is Ebtaraz."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Benni: "..."</span>
</p>

<h1 id="e26">From <em>Profile: Bennitri</em></h1>
<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>920, Yarzon-Ebott</em> </h1>

<p>
  <span>Bennitri was a human member of the Brujgal family living in Ri-Ebott. </span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Bennitri was born in 636 in Ebtaraz, a village of razil located underneath Mt. Ebott which would become a ghost town over the next 25 years due to lack of contact with the rest of Raz (the last inhabitant dying in 661). Bennitri left in 646, finding Tomi and thus the Brujgals a year later, similar to Khara later on. Bennitri's time associated with the family overlapped with Tomi-Rugan's time as de-facto King of Yarzon-Watershed, making Bennitri a prince. Bennitri was an influential figure during the Invasion of Yarzon-Watershed, having had a role in the events leading up to the war, first attempting to meet with Siegetev himself on behalf of Tomi-Rugan (inadvertently massively heightening tensions). However, once the Great Evacuation was caught and halted by Siegetev in 663 as it was nearing its completion, the Brujgal family belonged to the 1% of Yarzon-Watershed's population left behind (as a large portion of the other remnants were wiped out), and Bennitri was himself able to meet with Chief Engineer Altria, and convince her to design and create a barrier to contain the monsters of Liruzon, as opposed to Siegetev's original plan of wiping out Liruzon's monster population entirely and then going after Ezvelan. This barrier did ultimately end up being created (around Mt. Ebott, containing the monsters in the former site of Ebtaraz), but Bennitri chose to stay on the surface, wishing to leave Ebtaraz behind. Bennitri lived out his later years (722-749) isolated from civilization on the slopes of Mt. Ebott, and eventually died there in 749. </span>

  <span>The Ruerden Colony: A description of the explored lands so far</span>
</h3>

<p>
  <span>We arrive at Fort Sevevda; to the north along Ruerden Beach lies Fort Ruerden. Further inland are the hills of Echavi, down from which flows the Rivers Sevevda in the south (leading to Fort Sevevda) and Vavyer to the north. North is the long coastal region leading to Ilbanez and the lands of the Krizhan people, who have a short stature and furred bodies like those of the north. Continuing northward and deep into the lands of the Krizhan we have our own abandoned Fort Monzeyan, from which, while it had not been lost to brutal attacks by natives, we set out to explore the north, starting with the peninsulae of Montar and Valbar. The native warriors seem to fight in a trance-like 'rage state'. </span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Then, crossing the Ratavnos Bay, we reach Ratavnos proper, the snowy homeland of those first encountered in Ilbanez. The northern boundary of the Ruerden grant is the 64.5th parallel and its southern boundary is the location of Fort Sevevda at around 47.5 degrees north, which forms its own colonial region, encompassing the lands which yarov currently inhabit in both southern and northern Myalvi, which are among the largest concentrated populations of yarov known to Wilant.</span>
</p><h3>
  <span>The Karzen Colony: A description of the explored area of Myalvi</span>
</h3>

<p>
  <span>The region stretches south from Fort Sevevda, starting with Fort Karzen on the Karzen Beach. We approach the homeland of the yellow folk who resist our colonization, starting with what appears to be their northernmost realm, along the Sejodon Peninsula to the coast to the east. Across the bay lies Panavis, their homeland and where the Karzen grant's southern boundary is at 34 degrees north, and which sits just beyond the Dalrad Mountains that define the eastern edge of our familiar realm. The Karzen region, just like Ruerden to the north, stretches to the eastern coast of the continent, though it is unlikely given recent circumstances that this will be seen through to its proper conclusion. </span>

  <span>Dreda: "Interestingly, they seem to have used 'Myalvi' to refer to Liruzon and Ezvelan as a whole, and apparently the rest of the continent?."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Arsamitev: "Yeah, they were rather greedy back then. To be honest, they kinda still are. They don't get the fundamentals of how rulership works."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Dreda: "Also, look at these names they're using. Montar? Valbar? It's Montera! And Valvar! And it's the Alz peninsula, Valvar isn't even on it!".</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Arsamitev: "I'm telling you, it's Halz!"</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Dreda: "I can't make that sound! Uh, Ralz? I don't know."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Dreda: "Also, 'Sevevda' for the river Arelbanz? That's just ancient Hesanic for 'What the fuck are you saying?'!"</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Arsamitev: "I mean, makes sense. Some Hesanic person saw a wila waltz up to them and ask them something in a language they couldn't understand."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Dreda: "So let's see. At least they got Panavis right. Sejodon is actually Gazivoj, and Ratavnos is Ezvelan (with the Ratavnos Bay being the Gulf of Montera)."</span>

  <p>
  <span>The change to the new Sbeva-based production team was a bad call. The original people from Hesan understood the world of Durzir (obviously) and what stories there were to be told within it. I've seen and read a lot of other Durzir content by a bunch of different authors, and they all seem to get it as well.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>But not the new Mew Mew team. It's like they took one look at Mew Mew 1 and decided "hey, let's make a sequel!" without understanding anything else about how Durzir worked. For example, they chose (or did they even choose!?) to set it not in Durzir but in this awkward mashup of Durzir and Yona where donno exist and ruin Mew Mew's unique characteristic. In fact, they ruined Mew Mew's entire character in general! Please, do some basic research. Review: Mew Mew Kissy Cutie 2 is neither Kissy nor Cutie. It's trash. 0 stars.</span>

<h1 id="e30">From a commentary on Myalvi culture by an unknown author</h1>
<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>284, Niderazon</em> </h1>

<p>The way of Hierrau confounds me. Not only does it insist that marriage can only derive from irrational attraction and romance (implying that romance is a prerequisite for procreation, and thus restricting romance to opposing genders), and that BEST FRIEND relationships are exclusively among siblings, cousins, or parents to children (forbidding any strong relation outside the family unit), but it also attempts to impose those norms not just on its own followers but on US, the "vedil" who have nothing to do with their practices or culture.</p>

<p>What do they make of it (and, if we choose to follow, what should we make of it) when two married people turn against one another, or when their pairing is found unsuitable for raising their child? They have no choice but to leave the child or the family unit as a whole to be brought to harm, with no framework for polar pairing or child transfer, and no formal sense of responsibility on the parents. And this would happen far more with their strange impositions on romance; irrational relationships are much more volatile. Despite this, they insist on stretching out family units for long enough that they are distorted into unrecognizability.</p>

<p>And it is also confusing that romantic relationships, which realize similarly to BEST FRIEND relationships (differing by their origins and underlying emotions), are seen as an entirely opposing category - to confuse them is to commit a minor inaccuracy, but it is seen as almost offensive to those of Myalvi for no apparent reason, especially when describing members of a family.</p>


<h1 id="e31">From a compilation of the entries of Dr. Gaster</h1>
<h3 class="patchnotes"><em>908, Yarzon-Ebott</em> </h1>



<p>The following is a compilation of lab entries by our dear old Royal Scientist, Dr. Gaster! They provide some exciting insight into the construction of the CORE, and reveal that those grey folk might not be telling the complete story.</p>
<div class="infocontainer">
<h4>Entry #1:</h4>
<p>Ah, my old workplace... The Steamworks. It's been a long time, and the place has definitely seen better days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had an idea for a potential replacement for a while, and now that I've reorganized Royal Sciences, we can finally start the construction.</p>
<h4>Entry #2:</h4>
<p>"Royal Scientist", eh? Is that what people are calling me? I guess that is kind of what I am now, since Royal Sciences is, ehm, no longer all that royal....</p>
<p>And with Akhan living with Kar&eacute;li, this couldn't be a more interesting time for the Underground....</p>
<h4>Entry #3:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The planning is going well. There is, however, one concern brought to me by No. 3: the idea that extracting so much magical energy from Ebott could bind Ebott's magic to the CORE's continued operation.</p>
<p>This would prove disastrous were the CORE to shut down or stop working.</p>
<h4>Entry #4:</h4>
<p>Good news: No. 3's concerns are essentially unfounded, although in my investigations on what would happen were the CORE to overload, I have developed a potential concern.</p>
<h4>Entry #5:</h4>
<p>The CORE being overloaded would cause an immense surge in magic, which could severely weaken and ultimately break the timespace continuum, the results of which would be apocalyptic in scale.</p>
<h4>Entry #6:</h4>
<p>This should only happen under extreme circumstances, so as long as people are careful to ensure correct operation of the CORE, things should be fine. However, I have added safety features to avoid the worst.</p>
<h4>Entry #7:</h4>
<p>A lady, Alfi, and her child Alfi-Niv came to visit me regarding the progress on the CORE today. Alfi-Niv showed me a sliding puzzle: you slide tiles around and have to get all the lines on them to connect up.</p>
<p>It gave me an idea: what if parts of the CORE facility could be shuffled around to make things easier (or perhaps more intellectually stimulating?) to the people working at the facility?</p>
<p>On that note, I've also added puzzles to some of the CORE's mechanisms.</p>
<h4>Entry #8</h4>
<p>Akhan was found and killed by Royal Guards in Hotland recently. That makes three. I find Ruaeli's decision to kill all humans who enter detestable, and I swear to protect the next human that enters the Underground at all costs.</p>
<h4>Entry #9</h4>
<p>I'm now having Alfi's family over regularly to discuss the CORE's development. The youngest one, Alfi-Niv, has made some useful comments on things I'm honestly embarrassed that I missed, such as the problem of cooling the CORE down.</p>
<p>She suggested that ice be sent all the way from Snowdin to cool the CORE. Her ideas are always the silliest but also the most fascinating. Very, very interesting indeed.</p>
<h4>Entry #10</h4>
<p>I've had to step away from work on the CORE for the time being, and perhaps for the foreseeable future, because there has been an interesting development at home: a young skeleton, Arfia, has just... shown up at my lab and made himself at home.</p>
<p>Nobody knows where he came from, or anything else about him. Like Alfi-Niv, he seems to be uncannily smart for his age, but is a lot more laid-back. Since nobody else wanted Arfia, I've taken him in and am now raising him.</p>
<h4>Entry #11</h4>
<p>Alfi's family showed up again to discuss me stepping away from the CORE. Additionally, Arfia met Alfi-Niv for the first time: the two seemed like a perfect match for each other.</p>
<h4>Entry #12.</h4>
<p>It's been a while, and the CORE is now fully operational. While I'll still have to check in on operations to make sure everything goes smoothly during the first couple months.</p>
<p>The Steamworks will remain active to allow people working on science there to finish their work, and will shut down on its own accord. I hear they're already planning to shut off the main generator.</p>
<h4>Entry #13.</h4>
<p>Two new arrivals at the lab: Arfia showed up with another skeleton, Kobzo. Additionally, a human entered the Underground, and found my lab. Okhelai is a curious, perseverant one. I see myself in her, somewhat.</p>
<h4>Entry #14.</h4>
<p>Arfia suggested a new direction to explore: alternate timelines and parallel universes. I have already done preliminary research, and have become aware of scientifically interesting targets. Universes within universes. Realities below realities. This will be very interesting.</p>
<h4>Entry #15.</h4>
<p>I have created a device that is potentially capable of opening a gateway to access other realities, at least as a passive observer. The problem is that it requires a huge amount of power to activate.</p>
<p>There's only one source I can think of that can produce the amount of power required all at once for this to work.</p>
<h4>Entry #16.</h4>
<p>no No NO NO NO NO</p>
<p>I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS</p>
<p>ALFI-NIV WAS RIGHT. OKHELAI WAS RIGHT</p>
<p>WHAT HAVE I DONE?</p>
<p>WHAT HAVE I DONE!?<br /><br /></p>
</div>
<p>What happens next? Geheheh! Who knows?</p>
<p>There was only ever one more entry...</p>
<p>After that, it all stopped.</p>
